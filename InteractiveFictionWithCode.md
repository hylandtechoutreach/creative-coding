# Interactive Fiction with Code
Code can transform storytelling into a dynamic, interconnected experience for both the writer and the reader.

## Example Games
[itch.io has quite a few examples of games built using Twine.](https://itch.io/c/314317/twine-examples)

### Temple of No
[The Temple of No](https://crowscrowscrows.itch.io/the-temple-of-no) is the example shown during the presentation. The [source code](https://github.com/sno/the-temple-of-no) is available on GitHub - this is what Twine ultimately outputs.

## Lesson Plans & Use Cases
The Hyland Tech Outreach team has used Twine on a variety of occasions.

- [Interactive Storytelling Workshop (~2.5hrs)](https://github.com/hytechcamps/twine/blob/master/README.md#interactive-storytelling-with-twine)  
    - This workshop may be a bit out-of-date, but the overall message should still be relevant
- [Chatbot built with Twine](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Assets/Chatbot.html)  
    - This example was used to introduce a [lesson on conditional statements](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Conditionals/StudentDesc.html)
