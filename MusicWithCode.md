# Music With Code
The right pieces of code can create living works of sound and rhythm that could never have existed otherwise.

## Extempore
[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language and runtime environment designed to support **cyberphysical programming**, where a human programmer operates as an active agent in the world.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1FSsUV-8c) provides a great introduction to the concept of Live Coding and the wonder of an Extempore performance.

[This session](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/hackathon/Activities/ProgrammingSynthwaveSession/StudentDesc.html), part of a hackathon presented by Hyland Tech Outreach, introduced Extempore and demonstrated some of its capabilities. It uses [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/hto-projects/programming-synthwave).

### Examples
Here are some live coding examples:

- [Chilled Electro Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaT6FsS2Xvw)
- [Rhythmic Cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3v8gRzROkU)
- [Improvised Acid Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Av_eLy_xw)

## TunePad
[TunePad](https://tunepad.com) is a free online platform for creating music with the Python programming language.

[This video](https://vimeo.com/398767736) is a helpful overview of the history and philosophy of TunePad.

[This paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3502021) dives a bit deeper into TunePad's _playbooks_ and their support of creative workflows.

The [Learn TunePad site](https://learn.tunepad.com/) also has a bunch of great resources:

## ChucK
[ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/) is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation. ChucK offers a unique time-based, concurrent programming model that is precise and expressive (we call this **strongly-timed**), dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly.

[WebChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/ide/) is the online IDE for ChucK.

[This ChucK code](https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/deep/smb.ck) contains a ChucK rendition of the Super Mario Bros. "Ground Theme" by Koji Kondo. Copy and paste it into the IDE to hear the music!

## EarSketch
[EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) is a cool way to remix music with code.

[This page](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Possibilities/EarSketch.html) contains a variety of EarSketch examples.
