# Art with Code
With the power of Processing, even a simple script can create an exciting and original piece of art.

## Processing Examples
There are so many examples of Processing. The [Discover](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending) tab is a great way to explore. Here are some cool ones:

- [Suika Game](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2084936)
- [Drawing 3D Shapes](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2277705)
- [3D ASCII](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2139695)
- [Noise Turbulence Doodles Brush](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/143842)

Note that all of these can be forked and modified right in the browser!

## Lesson Plans & Use Cases
There are so many cool ways to teach using Processing. Here are some from Hyland Tech Outreach:

- [Introduction to Processing.py](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Processing/StudentDesc.html)
- [Processing Possibilities in JavaScript](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-js/Possibilities/Processing.html)  
    - Note: This was part of a "Scavenger Hunt" activity where students were meant to explore projects and find question answers
- [Learning Game: Coordinate Plane](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Processing/CoordinateClicker.html)  
    - This game was developed _with_ Processing to help _teach_ Processing
